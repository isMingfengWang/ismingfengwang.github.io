In biomedical research, AI algorithms can be used to reach diagnosis, predict disease progression and patients’ survival, recommend patients’ treatments and much more, which is all fascinating. But the question is: will these algorithms be ever applied in clinical practice and, in turn, improve people lives?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychobiology: looking at the bigger picture\n\n2020-11\nThe aim of the talk was to describe the potential of interdisciplinary research that crosses the boundaries of social and biological sciences, with a special focus on the field of psychobiology"

These studies have important applications in CO2 geological sequestration, underground wastwater treatment, and oil & gas extraction.\nI primarily use OpenFOAM for fluid flow simulations and am capable of developing custom solvers or modules as needed. In addition, I conduct fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations using the toolchain OpenFOAM + preCICE + Calculix.\nMy research interests also include applying machine learning to extract insights from fluid flow data. For example, I have developed machine learning-based methods to derive explicit predictive formulas for the permeability of porous media.\n\nKey topics\n\nPorous Media\nComputational Fluid Mechanics (CFD)\nContinuum Mechanics\nFluid Structure Interaction (FSI)\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nPhD student (2021.11 - Present) - University of Stuttgart\nMaster of Science (2017.09 - 2020.07) - Geological Engineering - China University of Geosciences (Beijing)\n\n\n\nSkills\n\nProgramming: C++, Python, Matlab\nSimulation Tools: OpenFOAM, Calculix, preCICE\nSupporting Tools: Yade, Gmsh, Salome, Aviza, ImageJ\n\n\n\nFurther links"
